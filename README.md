## Overview

Based on BeyondMimic , is a versatile humanoid control framework that provides highly dynamic motion tracking with the
state-of-the-art motion quality on real-world deployment and steerable test-time control with guided diffusion-based
controllers.

This repo covers the motion tracking training in BeyondMimic. **You should be able to
train any sim-to-real-ready motion in the LAFAN1 dataset, without tuning any parameters**.


## Installation

- Install Isaac Lab v2.1.0 by following
  the [installation guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html). We recommend
  using the conda installation as it simplifies calling Python scripts from the terminal.

- Clone this repository separately from the Isaac Lab installation (i.e., outside the `IsaacLab` directory):

- Using a Python interpreter that has Isaac Lab installed, install the library

```bash
python -m pip install -e source/x2_mimic_lab
```

## Motion Tracking


```bash
python scripts/csv_to_npz.py --input_file {motion_name}.csv --input_fps 30 --output_name {motion_name} --headless
```

This will automatically upload the processed motion file to the WandB registry with output name {motion_name}.

- Test if the WandB registry works properly by replaying the motion in Isaac Sim:
ï¼›
```bash
python scripts/replay_npz.py --registry_name={your-organization}-org/wandb-registry-motions/{motion_name}
```

- Debugging
    - Make sure to export WANDB_ENTITY to your organization name, not your personal username.
    - If /tmp folder is not accessible, modify csv_to_npz.py L319 & L326 to a temporary folder of your choice.

### Policy Training

- Train policy by the following command:

```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --task=Tracking-Flat-G1-v0 \
--registry_name {your-organization}-org/wandb-registry-motions/{motion_name} \
--headless --logger wandb --log_project_name {project_name} --run_name {run_name}
```

### Policy Evaluation

- Play the trained policy by the following command:

```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/play.py --task=Tracking-Flat-G1-v0 --num_envs=2 --wandb_path={wandb-run-path}
```

The WandB run path can be located in the run overview. It follows the format {your_organization}/{project_name}/ along
with a unique 8-character identifier. Note that run_name is different from run_path.

## Code Structure

Below is an overview of the code structure for this repository:

- **`source/whole_body_tracking/whole_body_tracking/tasks/tracking/mdp`**
  This directory contains the atomic functions to define the MDP for BeyondMimic. Below is a breakdown of the functions:

    - **`commands.py`**
      Command library to compute relevant variables from the reference motion, current robot state, and error
      computations. This includes pose and velocity error calculation, initial state randomization, and adaptive
      sampling.

    - **`rewards.py`**
      Implements the DeepMimic reward functions and smoothing terms.

    - **`events.py`**
      Implements domain randomization terms.

    - **`observations.py`**
      Implements observation terms for motion tracking and data collection.

    - **`terminations.py`**
      Implements early terminations and timeouts.

- **`source/whole_body_tracking/whole_body_tracking/tasks/tracking/tracking_env_cfg.py`**
  Contains the environment (MDP) hyperparameters configuration for the tracking task.

- **`source/whole_body_tracking/whole_body_tracking/tasks/tracking/config/g1/agents/rsl_rl_ppo_cfg.py`**
  Contains the PPO hyperparameters for the tracking task.

- **`source/whole_body_tracking/whole_body_tracking/robots`**
  Contains robot-specific settings, including armature parameters, joint stiffness/damping calculation, and action scale
  calculation.

- **`scripts`**
  Includes utility scripts for preprocessing motion data, training policies, and evaluating trained policies.

This structure is designed to ensure modularity and ease of navigation for developers expanding the project.
